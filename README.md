# Analysis-and-design-of-missile-two-loop-autopilot-pitch

a flight path rate demand two loop autopilot in pitch
plane called lateral autopilot is considered where the steady state gain
of the autopilot system is non-unity .The present work is an attempt to
achieve a unity steady state gain of the autopilot system which
generates a flight path rate output for a flight path rate command. For
this, a PI controller is introduced in the reduced order model of
autopilot system obtained through Routh Approximation method in
order to eliminate the static error and to obtain a unity steady state gain
of the two loop autopilot system . A model based PI design method
based on plants parameter is used for the calculation of PI gain values.
A numerical example has been considered and the simulation results
are obtained through MATLAB software.
